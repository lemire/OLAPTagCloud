	<h1>What's OlapTagCloud?</h1>
	<div class="longtext">
	<p>OlapTagCloud is a tool to study data sets using both a
	 Social Web approach and some of the traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP">OLAP</a> formalism.</p>
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">Tag clouds</a> have been used mostly in the context of collaborative 
	tagging, but we apply them to standard Business Intelligence problems. Our hope
	is that business intelligence can become more accessible and more collaborative.
	To a large extend, we want the user to specify the database schemas. We want the
	users to collaboratively decide which variables are more important.
	</p>
	
	<p>Tag clouds, as they are used in Web 2.0 sites,  are informal representation 
	meant to give a bird's eye view. Typically, the exact semantics of the various elements is 
	not given. What does the color or font size represent exactly?
	What does it mean if two tags are listed closed to each other? 
	What matter is that the user gets some information
	very quickly, and he can then use other tools to investigate further.
